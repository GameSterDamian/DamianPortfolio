<div class="indent">
<big>Since I was young, I've been interested in being creative, <em>especially with computers</em>. Over the years, I have worked on many websites, my biggest had a domain and a working forum, as well as many other features. I also love making <em>videos and skits</em>, and I am completely self taught, from the editing to the "acting" (putting in quotes because I'm not very good at acting). I've also recently been interested in creating <em>video games</em> with the advanced Unreal Engine 5, used by some of the biggest game studios in the world. I'm currently working on a multiplayer game to play with my friends.</big>

<div class="tabs demo">

  <input type="checkbox" id="title1" />
  <label for="title1">Video Making </label>
  
  <div class="content">
  
    <p>Since early 2018, I have been making videos, and since early 2021 I've been making skit videos. I do everything, from making the script, to editing. I also have made gaming videos, which I spend a long time editing. My longest skit is 10 minutes long and it took hours to film and edit.</p>
  
  </div>
  
  <input type="checkbox" id="title2" />
  <label for="title2">Cooking </label>
  
  <div class="content">
  
    <p>I am doing a Culinary Arts class in my school this year, and I have earned a California Food Handler card. Though I am still learning, I really enjoy cooking.</p>
  
  </div>
  
  <input type="checkbox" id="title3" />
  <label for="title3">Coding </label>
  
  <div class="content">
  
    <p>I have never fully learned a coding language, but I've made many things using code such as websites, and a virus (more about that in the projects page). I've had experience in Phython, HTML, CSS, VBS, and Java, however I haven't fully learned one. I am slowly learning HTML as you probably see now.</p>
  
  </div>

  <input type="checkbox" id="title4" />
  <label for="title4">Music Making </label>
  
  <div class="content">
  
    <p>Started in 2018, I have made many different songs. My old songs weren't that great, but I'm very proud of my new music.</p>
  
  </div>

<input type="checkbox" id="title5" />
<label for="title5">PC Building </label>

<div class="content">

  <p>I wasn't sure if I should put this here, becuase I actually haven't built a full PC. I have modified the parts in my own PC and given advice to people about which parts to get for their PC. I'm confident I could do it, because I have done many hours of research in this topic.</p>

</div>

<input type="checkbox" id="title6" />
<label for="title6">Biking </label>

<div class="content">

  <p>I think biking is a great way to get exercise, and it's fun too. I love biking around the city I live in.</p>

</div>

<input type="checkbox" id="title7" />
<label for="title7">Game Development </label>

<div class="content">

  <p>Over the years I have made a few very small games, but recently I have been committing to it more, making a full level for a game made for my brother, and like I mentioned before now I'm making a multiplayer game.</p>

</div>

<input type="checkbox" id="title8" />
<label for="title8">3D Animation </label>

<div class="content">

  <p>Using the same program I use for game development, Unreal Engine, I also made a short 3D animation to go with my skit, which actually turned out better than I expected. I am sure I will make more soon.</p>

</div>

<input type="checkbox" id="title9" />
<label for="title9">Writing </label>

<div class="content">

  <p>I like writing sometimes, I'd say I'm pretty good at it. I like making short stories.</p>

</div>

<input type="checkbox" id="title10" />
<label for="title10">Video Games </label>

<div class="content">

  <p>I know it's a waste of time, but it's great when I don't have anything to do. It's also good inspiration for my own game development.</p>
