      <p><big>Hacker Skit</big></p>
      <p>
      Dec 19, 2022
      </p>
      <p>I made a skit about a hacker, it was a joke/parody of how hackers are portrayed in movies. It begins with someone on the news talking about how a hacker was found in the sewers, which I payed someone on Fiverr to do, and it cuts to a 3D animation I made of sewers. After that, the rest is fast paced clips of the "hacker" "hacking" with cuts to the police walking through the sewers until they show up and catch the hacker.</p>
      <p>ETA Completed in: 7-9 hours across 5 days.</p>
      <p><big>Creepy Jacket Man Movie</big></p>
      <p>
      Aug 31, 2022
      </p>
      <p>Creepy Jacket Man is a joke character I made in 2020, making fun of characters in fake "creepy" videos created for small children that are easily tricked. Creepy Jacket Man is a guy in an oversized jacket that makes strange noises. I made a Creepy Jacket Man skit, then a second one (which I never published). I found a local film festival for teens, so I joined it and used Creepy Jacket Man for the main character. I am surprised how complicated I managed to make the plot, it involves time travel, a younger version of Creepy Jacket Man before he turned evil, and I spent so long with all aspects of this film. To film, I went to my old school because one room looks sort of like a lab, and I spent around 4-5 hours filming and acting with my mom, my brother, and my friend. While editing, I spent a long time making sure the music fit with what was happening, and I think I did a good job. I got 3rd or 4th place in the festival I think. Watching my Creepy Jacket Man film again, I don't like it. I mean I'm happy I put so much effort into something like this and it turned out better than I expected, but I think I took a funny idea and turned it way too serious. It was never meant to be a serious character, but in the film there was almost no funny elements at all. Like the second one, I didn't publish this one either.</p>
      <p>ETA Completed in: 10-12 hours across 8 days.</p>
      <p><big>Soda Ad Parody</big></p>
      <p>
      Nov 15, 2021
      </p>
      <p>Probably my best skit ever, this was a parody of soda ads (even though I hadn't even watched any reference footage for the ads, don't tell anyone). My cousin and his girlfriend were over for dinner, so we decided to act out a skit I had written a script for the day before, which me, my cousin, and my brother got the idea for cousin's house the day earlier. The skit was about a drink called Poopsi, with the slogan "Like Shit, But Better". At first there's a scene of us all having fun at dinner, that was our actual dinner, then I poured the drink (which was water) all over my face. After that, each person says a few lines about Poopsi, and each person has something happen to them, such as spitting out the drink or getting held at gunpoint. After that, me and my cousin went by the lake to take a picture for the thumbnail, and we filmed another scene where I take the drink out of water, with a voiceover of me saying over 50 of the (deadly) side effects. It was so funny filming this skit, we had to film my cousin spitting out the water around 5 times because we couldn't stop laughing, you can actually hear us laughing if you listen carefully.</p>
      <p>ETA Completed in: 5-8 hours across 3 days.</p>
      <p><big>Smaller Projects</big></p>
      <p>
      2021-2022
      </p>
      <p>The First Creepy Jacket Man</p>
      <p>This was my first skit, but it was unscripted and boring. I am mentioning it here because it's iconic for my channel. I was watching crappy fake creepy videos ironicly so I decided to create a skit making fun of those videos. The skit is about a guy in a oversized jacket chasing another person,</p>
      <p>ETA Completed in: 15-30 minutes across 1 day.</p>
      <p>When Your Mom Doesn't Get You the New Call of Duty</p>
      <p>Though Creepy Jacket Man was actually my first skit, I consider this my first skit because Creepy Jacket Man was terrible. My friend was over and we were bored, so we decided to make a skit. This skit was inspired by Call of Duty, a video game we were playing together a lot. We both have "guns" and we shoot each other, basically. Then, the majority of the video is actually bloopers.</p>
      <p>ETA Completed in: 2-3 hours across 2 days.</p>
      <p>Killed my Friend</p>
      <p>I did not name this skit very well, on my channel it's called "So I Killed my Friend (Stealth Edition)". It was done shortly after the previous skit, again with my friend. It was supposed to be a Halloween "creepy" skit, but it turned out to be a suspenceful skit instead. It shows the main character walking slowly, and he goes into a room and gets shot (with a nerf gun). For a second everything stops and then you find out the main character is alive, hiding by a bed for cover. The main character leaps over the bed and beats up the guy with the gun and then it ends. This skit used suspenceful music that matched with what was happening, and I was proud of it.</p>

      <p><big>Multiplayer Project</big></p>
      <p>
      ??? ??, 2022
      </p>
      <p>I am working on a multiplayer game to play with my friends made in Unreal Engine 5, but if I make a good enough game I might publish it on popular platforms. I don't know when or if it will be done, but I am hoping it will.</p>
      <p>ETA Completed in: Still working on it</p>
      <p><big>Oliver Facility</big></p>
      <p>
      Dec 24, 2022
      </p>
      <p>This is a game I made for my brother in Unreal Engine 5, sort of as a Christmas present. I originally was going to make a joke game, but it ended up being a lot bigger than I expected. It takes around 10 minutes to complete, but it could take a lot more or a lot less depending on the person. In this game, you are stuck in a facility, and you have to escape. You are given a gun, and some walls can be destroyed with the gun. You also have a grapple, that can help you get to areas you couldn't get to on foot. Eventually, you get to a platform with an impossible puzzle which would only be possible with the grapple, however, if you do use the grapple the whole platform will fall. You fall into an area full of lava, rising quickly. It is possible to make it out, but it is challenging if it's your first try. I might add more to this game some day, but I doubt I will.</p>

      <p><big>Music</big></p>
      <p>
      2022
      </p>
      <p>Someone in my school started a music club that went one day a week, where we do anything music related. Since my friend was already creating music, he joined and I did too because I am interested in music making. With his help, I easily learned Ableton Live, a music DAW, which means digital audio workstation, a program for making music and sound design. At first, I experimented with different features of the program, but I soon started actually creating music. With him there to guide me, I created really cool songs. This music club lasted around 6 months I believe, and I finished 5 songs, and I worked on many different cool songs, 2 of which are unfinished, and the rest I scrapped. Me and my friend made a collaboration (which he did most of the work on) and it turned out great. It was a really fun project to do, and I hope I can do something like this with my friend in the future.</p>
      <p>ETA Completed in: 3-5 hours over 2-3 days.</p>
      <p><big>Virus</big></p>
      <p>
      2021
      </p>
      <p>My friend was over for 10 days, and we both enjoy coding, so we decided to each create a computer virus. We used the coding language VBS (Visual Basic Script), which we both had no knowledge of, so we looked up how to do things as we were going. The challenge was whoever created the better virus (saying better was pretty vague, not sure if we meant more destructive, or more cool looking) won. We didn't win a prize, we just won satisfaction I guess. My virus just displayed errors, and it was meant to look like someone connected to your PC. It opened up the camera app, and showed your face (if you had a facecam plugged in), then it opened up notepad and typed some messages, then it opened up Command Prompt and pretended it was deleting files. At the end it gave you a choice. One option would restart your PC and have the virus delete itself (I thought that was pretty cool), and the other option would have an infinite loop of errors. The virus would be very easy to delete, but I thought it was pretty cool that I managed to make a virus with a coding language I didn't know. My friend made a few different versions of his virus, but I remember that his opened up a ton of tabs on his web browser. I won the contest. It was really fun to do, I enjoyed it.</p>
      <p>ETA Completed in: 3-5 hours over 2-3 days.</p>
      <p><big>Minecraft Server</big></p>
      <p>
      2020
      </p>
      <p>For some context, Minecraft is a game where you can build anything, do anything, have adventures, and fight enemies called mobs. Some Minecraft fans create "Minecraft servers", basically a server that allows players to connect to it and play together. There are some servers that have had over 200k players online at once and make millions of dollars a year. If you know Minecraft, me making a server sounds like something a small kid would do, nothing big or anything, to be fair I was and still am pretty young. If you want to make a complicated Minecraft server, it does take a lot of creativity and work to customize it and use these things called "plugins" (basically modifications that wouldn't be included in the default game, made by enthusiasts of the game). I had around 75 of those if I remember, and most of them were fully customized by me. Also, I had a fully customized website with a store where people could purchase in game perks, a forum, and a domain. I never released it, because I realised it would take a lot of money and time to make it successful.</p>
      <p>ETA Completed in: 50 hours or more over 3 or more months, not fully completed.</p>
      <p><big>Castle Wars</big></p>
      <p>
      Around 2019
      </p>
      <p>Castle Wars was also a Minecraft server, however I used a custom coded plugin. I had the idea, but I didn't know how to code in Java (Minecraft's coding language), so I paid someone to code it for me. The idea was a "mini game" (small simple game inside of another game) where 2 teams of people built a base on opposite sides of an arena, with walls separating them, then after 15 minutes the walls seperating them dropped and they had to fight each other, utilizing their bases that they built. The idea was fairly simple, however I paid someone that ended up being a terrible person. His code had a lot of bugs, and a lot of features I asked for were missing, and he refused to fix them. He actually ended up DDoSing me, making my internet temporarily shut off. He was able to do that to me because I joined his Minecraft server which gave him my IP, it's complicated. I got my money back though. After that, I paid someone else to make a better version of it, and he did a great job, however I was stupid back then and I lost access to that file. To this day, I am still looking for him, to see if he somehow still has my file.</p>
      <p>ETA Completed in: two weeks, more or less. Not sure how long it took them to code it.</p>
